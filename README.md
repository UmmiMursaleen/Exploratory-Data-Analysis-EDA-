ðŸŒŸ Exploring the Dynamics of Roller Coasters through Data Science ðŸŽ¢

I'm thrilled to share my recent project where I applied data analysis techniques to explore and visualize data from a comprehensive roller coaster dataset. This project highlights how data can provide fascinating insights into the world of amusement rides.

Key highlights include:

Data Cleaning & Preparation: Handled missing and duplicate values to create a clean, structured dataset for analysis.
Statistical Analysis: Analyzed trends such as the relationship between speed, height, and inversions, along with patterns in year of introduction.
Visualizations: Created impactful visualizations using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover insights, such as trends in coaster design over time and speed distributions.
Correlations: Explored relationships between various metrics like speed, height, and G-force, using heatmaps and scatter plots.
This project was a fun dive into the intersection of engineering marvels and data science, demonstrating how analytical tools can reveal stories behind the numbers.

Check out the visualizations and findings in my project! I'd love to hear your thoughts or suggestions for further exploration. ðŸš€
